      <p> The project was designed to help teenagers develop better behaviors by maintaining a virtual self, which aided in effective time and emotional management. Launched in 2019, it reached 10,000 active users in six months. However, due to everyone's busy schedules, we couldn't maintain it :/ </p>

      <p> We created a Crypto Email service, one of the first on the market. While the exact need for it wasn't clear, the popularity of web3  help us attracted grant funding. I'm still considering what the real value of the project might be. Yet, I see the blockchain as promising for other uses, like the gig economy.</p>

     <p> Work with Yaohua Bu, Suqi Lou </p>
     <p> Chat-based Supervision Services, an emerging gig economy in China that aims to assist people in achieving better task completion and behavior change. We conducted a mixed-methods study that included an analysis of user reviews (N = 792) and interviews (N = 21) with those who had experience with CSS,Findings reveal the motivations and practices of clients and supervisors. We identify three key practices of CSS that promote behavior change: task reminders and tracking at the core, experience-based information support and emotional support as secondary support, and flexibility and personalization as key factors. We also explored the multiple social roles of supervisors in CSS.</p>
