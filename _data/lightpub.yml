        abstract: This paper examines teenagers' chat-based cosplay in China. We found four primary motivations and their main practice. Adolescents perceived character presentation as key and devoted significant effort to refine their characters for higher consistency. We spotlight the interplay between social relationships and story creation, and also note both positive and negative experiences within the community.

        abstract:  Drawing inspiration from shape-changing food research, we propose an approach that combines deformable wafer paper for food preparation. We summarize the principles of wafer paper controllable deformation and develop a toolkit to facilitate its use. We support children increating personalized, transformable food items using this method.

        abstract: We propose a method for exaggerated visual-speech feedback in CAPT. The speech exaggeration is realized by an emphatic speech generation neural network based on Tacotron, while the visual exaggeration is accomplished by ADC Viseme Blending, namely increasing Amplitude of movement, extending the phone’s Duration and enhancing the color Contrast.

        abstract: We propose a four-stage method to build read-aiding e-books directly from text, integrating the technologies in text mining and the ideas in interactive aesthetics. By applying this method, we manage to identify and present multiple complex relationships in the classical Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, providing readers with vivid scenes and rich interactions for better comprehension.
