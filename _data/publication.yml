        abstract: We introduce an empathy-based approach that allows users to experience how privacy behaviors may alter system outcomes in a risk-free sandbox environment from the perspective of artificially generated personas. To generate realistic personas, we introduce a novel pipeline that augments the outputs of large language models using few-shot learning, contextualization, and chain of thoughts.

        abstract: This paper explores the experiences of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) food delivery workers in China. We focus on their motivations, like better pay and community belonging, and their use of delivery platform tools, such as AI voice calls, for communication. Despite technological aids, human intervention remains important. We identify challenges such as safety risks, multitasking complexities, and mistrust in AI voice calls. Our findings offer insights for designing inclusive delivery platforms and broader implications for employment opportunities for DHH individuals, particularly in developing countries.

        abstract: In China, Virtual romance service (VRS) provides a direct dyadic intimacy, different from fan-idol parasocial ties. Our study of 178 surveys and 22 interviews revealed virtual lovers' strategies to meet customers' emotional needs. Customers value VRS for its emotional benefits without the need for long-term commitment. We conclude with insights into the unique nature of virtual lovers and design implications for digital companionship.

        abstract: L2 English learners find it difficult to improve pronunciation due to lack of personalized feedback. This paper presents Pronunciation Teacher (PTeacher), a CAPT system offering personalized exaggerated audio-visual feedback. Interviewing 100 L2 learners and 22 native teachers, we propose three metrics to determine exaggeration levels in both modalities. We incorporate dynamic feedback based on learner proficiency. User studies indicate our system improves learning efficiency.

              abstract = {Second language (L2) English learners often find it difficult to improve their pronunciations due to the lack of expressive and personalized corrective feedback. In this paper, we present Pronunciation Teacher&nbsp;(PTeacher), a Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system that provides personalized exaggerated audio-visual corrective feedback for mispronunciations. Though the effectiveness of exaggerated feedback has been demonstrated, it is still unclear how to define the appropriate degrees of exaggeration when interacting with individual learners. To fill in this gap, we interview 100 L2 English learners and 22 professional native teachers to understand their needs and experiences. Three critical metrics are proposed for both learners and teachers to identify the best exaggeration levels in both audio and visual modalities. Additionally, we incorporate the personalized dynamic feedback mechanism given the English proficiency of learners. Based on the obtained insights, a comprehensive interactive pronunciation training course is designed to help L2 learners rectify mispronunciations in a more perceptible, understandable, and discriminative manner. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our system significantly promotes the learnersâ€™ learning efficiency.},
